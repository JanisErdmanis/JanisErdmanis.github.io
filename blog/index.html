The journey, although challenging, has been enlightening, and I have been focusing on the development of a new e-voting system since I graduated from my PhD program two years ago. Today, I am excited to introduce you to the PeaceFounder project, which is not just another e-voting system but one that aims to raise the bar and overcome the limitations of mainstream E2E verifiable voting systems.</div></div> <div class=post-display><div class=post-meta>Aug 11, 2023 | 939 Words</div><div class=post-title><a href=/blog/org-franklin>Transitioning from Org to Franklin</a></div><div class=post-description>Like many, I serve my website with GitHub Pages, greatly reducing the burden.

Many substantial decisions on user experience, security assumptions and design are taken frequently, and most of the time, it is a learning journey. As a result, the system design has evolved unrecognisably over the years. Here I blog on the new developments in the project and how I see the evoting problem.</div></div> <div class=post-display><div class=post-meta>Feb 25, 2019 | 2320 Words</div><div class=post-title><a href=/blog/julia-cluster>Julia on a PBS cluster</a></div><div class=post-description>A time comes when computation is too expensive to run. If you are lucky, you can adjust the parameters of the numerical method or find a better one. If that is not the case, you are now looking at what the phrase parallel computing promises. Often the numerical tasks can be reduced to actor-model, meaning that there is a single master giving orders to the computing slaves. Most programming languages give many tools for these capabilities; however, the way and complexity can alienate us from using them. I believe this is another strength of Julia which shows us a better and more elegant way: this blog post.</div></div> <div class=post-display><div class=post-meta>Dec 26, 2018 | 1302 Words</div><div class=post-title><a href=/blog/remarkable>The tool on my desk: ReMarkable tablet</a></div><div class=post-description>I used to spend countless hours to make reading and note-taking experience better with the tools I had, a laptop and Kindle eink reader, but the efforts I was investing made me unsatisfied with the result. Perhaps I am easily disturbed by nuisances - eye irritation, unreadability, synchronisation, and convenience - which stood before my goals and started forming a goal itself. If only there would have been A4 sized e-reader on which one could write at that time.

I admit I had different expectations, so being under constant change makes it hard to reflect on how I feel, perform, and what future I see. But now, when my first year had passed in the TU Delft, and I was required to submit my self-reflection for the Go/NoGo meeting, I made a conscious effort on where I stand. Over this time, I have had some unusual thoughts which might form an opinion and recipes posted on my webpage. But for now, about my part of TU Delft.</div></div> <div class=post-display><div class=post-meta>May 9, 2018 | 507 Words</div><div class=post-title><a href=/blog/research-weyl-disk>The quantum fluctuations in the vicinity of Weyl point</a></div><div class=post-description>Superconductors exhibit unique charge transport, leading to intriguing interface phenomena with normal metals. Electrons and holes form closed trajectories at specific energies, known as Andreev-bound states. It is possible to envision a situation where Andreev-bound states can cross in superconducting phase space, forming Weyl points. But what if the superconducting phases are not fixed and are subject to quantum fluctuations near those Weyl points?</div></div> <div class=post-display><div class=post-meta>Jan 1, 2018 | 636 Words</div><div class=post-title><a href=/blog/reflection-2017>Reflection on 2017</a></div><div class=post-description>It was a stressful but successful year. I published my first paper, concluding my scientific activities in Latvia, and with determination and support from peers, I entered the PhD program at TU Delft. In a completely unfamiliar environment, where I am compelled to develop myself further, aligning with my commitment for the upcoming year as well. Much more grounded than what I have achieved in the past year :).</div></div> <div class=post-display><div class=post-meta>Nov 16, 2017 | 1596 Words</div><div class=post-title><a href=/blog/julia-experience>Julia type system and multiple dispatch</a></div><div class=post-description>I used to be a Python advocate as having an interpreter, meaningful error messages, docstrings, and easy library installation made the scope of what I could build expand tremendously. But in 2015, the Cython, Numba or C interop story became unbearable for my MSc thesis project, and I made a plunge into Julia, and I never looked back. As saying says, you come to Julia for performance and stay there multiple dispatch, type system, REPL, Pkg and other neat things.</div></div> <div class=post-display><div class=post-meta>Jul 9, 2017 | 2352 Words</div><div class=post-title><a href=/blog/email-with-emacs>Email with emacs</a></div><div class=post-description>The user faced usability issues with the Gmail web application, which led me to explore email client alternatives on Ubuntu like Geary and Nylas1, but those also had limitations and bugs.

Here I show my setup with Raspberries using BitTorrent Sync and how I have configured it with an RClone cron job to synchronise with the cloud.</div></div> <div class=post-display><div class=post-meta>Feb 21, 2017 | 2420 Words</div><div class=post-title><a href=/blog/digispark>Building with Arduino and Digisparck</a></div><div class=post-description>I lost my interest in making things with Arduino due to an ugly Arduino ide, debugging frustrations and lack of easy options for deploying what I make.

However, due to some bugs and limitations, I eventually turned to Inkscape, the best vector graphics editor on Linux, widely used by physicists for figure editing. A Sozi plugin allows to create a single-page poster-like layout and specify regions for each slide, resembling a whiteboard to organise thoughts and ideas.</div></div> <div class=post-display><div class=post-meta>Feb 11, 2017 | 1065 Words</div><div class=post-title><a href=/blog/my-cern-trip>My CERN internship</a></div><div class=post-description>For two months this summer, I was part of the CERN summer student program.

When subjected to fast-rotating magnetic fields of different intensities, these droplets exhibit intricate shapes such as oblate, three-axial, and starfish. The project aimed to determine whether a simple magnetic drop model could explain this complex behaviour under strong magnetic fields, where equilibrium arises from the interplay between scalar surface tension and linear magnetic force.</div></div> <div class=post-display><div class=post-meta>Jan 1, 2017 | 327 Words</div><div class=post-title><a href=/blog/research-wigner>Understanding quantum state of emitted electron</a></div><div class=post-description>At a nanoscale at cold sub kelvin temperatures and large magnetic fields, an electron for a few centimetres flows like photons on optical fiber coherently. This enables envisioning an electron interferometer experiment on a solid state device; thus, a question on preparing an electron quantum state becomes important. In my BSc thesis project, I derived and, using Python, computed the resulting state of an electron emitted from an electric field veil lowering one of its barriers.</div></div> <div class=page-foot > <a href="http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/4.0/">CC BY-SA 4.0</a> Janis Erdmanis.
