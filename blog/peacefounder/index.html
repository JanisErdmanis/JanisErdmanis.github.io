Many substantial decisions on user experience, security assumptions and design are taken frequently, and most of the time, it is a learning journey. As a result, the system design has evolved unrecognisably over the years. Here I blog on the new developments in the project and how I see the evoting problem. </p> <p>The current articles come from the beginning of the project and provide only historical records of what things have been explored. In contrast to the main blog page, I have not edited them with Grammarly, and thus could be more readable. Nevertheless, that reminds me to convert my internal notes to exciting blog posts soon.</p> <div class=post-display><div class=post-meta>Sep 20, 2023 | 1252 Words</div><div class=post-title><a href=/blog/introducing-peacefounder>Introducing PeaceFounder</a></div><div class=post-description>Around four years ago, I began exploring electronic voting (e-voting) systems by scratching an itch I had. The journey, although challenging, has been enlightening, and I have been focusing on the development of a new e-voting system since I graduated from my PhD program two years ago. Today, I am excited to introduce you to the PeaceFounder project, which is not just another e-voting system but one that aims to raise the bar and overcome the limitations of mainstream E2E verifiable voting systems.</div></div> <div class=post-display><div class=post-meta>Sep 9, 2019 | 638 Words</div><div class=post-title><a href=/blog/democracy-credit>Git for evoting?</a></div><div class=post-description>A foundation for an electronic voting system could be established through a git-based repository, with contributors possessing merge rights functioning as a governing body. This body would ensure precise vote tallying and supervise the execution of approved proposals. In this context, I suggest an electronic voting system wherein a trusted party equitably distributes public keys to members, enabling them to cast their votes.</div></div> <div class=post-display><div class=post-meta>Sep 9, 2019 | 512 Words</div><div class=post-title><a href=/blog/evote-democracy>How evoting could help for democracy?</a></div><div class=post-description>There is a great difficulty in designing an electronic voting system that combines transparency, user verifiability, anonymity, and resistance against bribery. In response to this, I propose a decentralized scheme, utilizing a Github-like repository where a board of members with merge rights represents a virtual state.</div></div> <div class=post-display><div class=post-meta>Sep 9, 2019 | 953 Words</div><div class=post-title><a href=/blog/evote>Electronic voting system based on ring signatures</a></div><div class=post-description>Inspired by Monero cryptocurrency's transparency and anonymity, I propose a decentralized voting scheme based on universal ring signatures. In this scheme, citizens would receive ID cards containing private keys for signing messages, and a central authority would manage public keys and messages for parties. While the idea offers potential benefits, I discuss challenges such as complex implementation, security concerns.</div></div> <div class=post-display><div class=post-meta>Jun 22, 2018 | 1213 Words</div><div class=post-title><a href=/blog/electronic-voting>Some thoughts on electronic voting</a></div><div class=post-description>Every time when I hear about upcoming elections, I imagine a future where I can vote from anywhere for officials who truly represent our state's interests. However, the trust issues inherent in conventional centralized or blockchain-based electronic voting systems quickly dampen this dream. Despite these challenges, I believe trust concerns can be overcome and have embarked on the intellectual challenge of designing a solution based on modern cryptographic algorithms.</div></div> <h1 id=references ><a href="#references" class=header-anchor >References</a></h1> <ul> <li><p><a href="https://peacefounder.org">peacefounder.org</a></p> <li><p><a href="https://github.com/PeaceFounder">github.com/PeaceFounder</a></p> <li><p><a href="https://peacefounder.org/PeaceFounder.jl/dev/">Documentation for PeaceFounder</a></p> </ul> <div class=page-foot > <a href="http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/4.0/">CC BY-SA 4.0</a> Janis Erdmanis.
