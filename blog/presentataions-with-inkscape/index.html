I had experienced strange bugs with LibreOffice, which I was trying to get rid of. I had also tried to use latex beamer templates, but I could not stand the empty spaces and misaligned pictures. For a time, I thought I had a solution with <a href="http://ipe.otfried.org/">ipe,</a> designed for scientific drawing and could edit multipage pdf documents &#40;created by ipe only&#41; and is deeply integrated with latex. Unfortunately, I did experience some click object bugs, which made usage of it irritating. Eventually, I gave Inkscape a second look.</p> <p>Inkscape is the best vector graphics editor on Linux, which is widely used in physics for <a href="http://physics.stackexchange.com/questions/401/what-software-programs-are-used-to-draw-physics-diagrams-and-what-are-their-rel">figure making</a> but requires you to use an extension for including latex formulas and takes a bit of time until you learn how to make it useful &#40;which I also now use extensively&#41;. Since in presentations, I use the same editing capabilities, I thought about using them also for my presentations. And I found two options - Jessylink and Sozi. With Jessylink, it is possible to create traditional-looking presentations which convert layers to slides which is a good option, but Sozi offered something better.</p> <p>In Sozi, you create a single page first, like a poster and then specify regions on which to look on each slide. I look at it as a big whiteboard on which you do organise your thoughts and then try to use them with a stick. The essentials of how I make presentations can be seen in a following image:</p> <p><img src=presentation-with-inkscape-sozi.png  alt="" /></p> <h2 id=using_latex_for_formulas_and_text ><a href="#using_latex_for_formulas_and_text" class=header-anchor >Using LaTeX for formulas and text</a></h2> <p>The first thing to note is that <code>.svg</code> specification does not support flowed text &#40;breaking into lines&#41;; thus, LaTeX must be used for making also text content. The default LaTeX way of including LaTeX content <code>Render/LaTeX</code> gives good results but does not allow to edit the content after it is created. Thus not suitable for writing long formulas and text. A better option is <a href="https://pav.iki.fi/software/textext/">Tex Text</a>.</p> <p>With Tex Text, I am able to use my own LaTeX preamble, which is very helpful in setting the width for the text and solving shortcomings of SVG specification. Also, I can use my own macros, which becomes useful when you do copy formulas from your paper. Thus, I copied out my preamble from paper and used it in Tex Text which, for my own good, I paste here:</p> <pre><code class="julia hljs">\usepackage{bm}
    \usepackage[papersize={<span class=hljs-number >4.0</span><span class=hljs-keyword >in</span>, <span class=hljs-number >6.2</span><span class=hljs-keyword >in</span>},total={<span class=hljs-number >3.9</span><span class=hljs-keyword >in</span>, <span class=hljs-number >6.0</span><span class=hljs-keyword >in</span>}]{geometry}
    % \renewcommand{\normalsize}{\fontsize{<span class=hljs-number >12</span>}{<span class=hljs-number >12</span>}\selectfont}
    % \DeclareMathSizes{<span class=hljs-number >12</span>}{<span class=hljs-number >7</span>}{<span class=hljs-number >5</span>}{<span class=hljs-number >5</span>}

    {\XXint\displaystyle\textstyle{<span class=hljs-comment >#1}}%</span>
    {\XXint\textstyle\scriptstyle{<span class=hljs-comment >#1}}%</span>
    {\XXint\scriptstyle\scriptscriptstyle{<span class=hljs-comment >#1}}%</span>
    {\XXint\scriptscriptstyle\scriptscriptstyle{<span class=hljs-comment >#1}}%</span>
    \!\int}
    \def\XXint<span class=hljs-comment >#1#2#3{{\setbox0=\hbox{$#1{#2#3}{\int}$}</span>
    \vcenter{\hbox{$<span class=hljs-comment >#2#3$}}\kern-.5\wd0}}</span>
    \def\ddashint{\Xint=}
    \def\dashint{\Xint {\boldsymbol -}}

Usually, it comes in handy with downloading content cropping out some specific parts and speeding them up and converting to <code>.mp4,</code> which the web browser can understand. While for the first part, I recommend checking out <a href="https://rg3.github.io/youtube-dl/">youtube-dl</a> and finding straightforward resources on how to use it on the internet. For the second part, I will briefly review usage for the <code>ffmpeg</code> converter. </p> <p>For cutting out a video from the 1st to the 39th second of the input video use:</p> <pre><code class="julia hljs">ffmpeg -i input.mp4 -vf trim=<span class=hljs-number >1</span>:<span class=hljs-number >39</span> output.mp4</code></pre>
<p>for speeding up the video 10 times and setting the output frame rate to 60 do:</p>
<pre><code class="julia hljs">ffmpeg -i input.mp4 -r <span class=hljs-number >60</span> -vf setpts=<span class=hljs-number >0.1</span>*PTS output.mp4</code></pre>
<p>and to crop specific parts of a video use:</p>
<pre><code class="julia hljs">ffmpeg -i input.mp4 -vf crop=outw:outh:x:y output.mp4</code></pre>
<p>where <code>outw</code>, <code>outh</code> is the width and height of cropped region and <code>x</code>, <code>y</code> is the top left corner of the cropping region. The actions above are not limited to mp4 alone. For example, <code>.avi</code> and <code>.org</code> formats are also supported. Also, it is possible to nest these actions in a single line by adding multiple <code>-vf</code> arguments in a single line.</p>
<p>The last step is ensuring that the video is playable by a browser. For avi file I do conversion with a command:</p>
<pre><code class="julia hljs">ffmpeg -i input.avi -acodec libfaac -b:a <span class=hljs-number >128</span>k -vcodec mpeg4 -b:v <span class=hljs-number >1200</span>k -flags +aic+mv4 output.mp4</code></pre>
<p>which gives me a browser-playable mp4 file. Sometimes mp4 files are not playable in the browser. In that case, I have successfully reconverted them with a code snippet:</p>
<pre><code class="julia hljs">ffmpeg -i input.mp4 -c:v libx264 -crf <span class=hljs-number >23</span> -preset medium -c:a aac -b:a <span class=hljs-number >128</span>k -movflags +faststart -vf scale=-<span class=hljs-number >2</span>:<span class=hljs-number >720</span>,format=yuv420p output.mp4</code></pre>
<p>which I found somewhere on the internet.</p>
<p>When you have a video in proper mp4 format, you can use it in presentation with the Sozi plugin. Put the video where your SVG file is and add it to your SVG from <code>Extensions/Sozi Extras/Add video or audio...</code> where the video with height and path needs to be specified. The video in Inkscape should appear as a grey box which you can place where you need it. The following picture shows it in action:</p>

<p>Recently I gave a presentation at our local conference, which you can find <a href=Conference-2017-feb.svg >here</a>. Also, since it is a web page, I can embed content in my web page with the following code snippet &#40;Note that for some reason only Firefox can preview it correctly&#41;:</p>
<pre><code class="julia hljs">&lt;embed src=<span class=hljs-string >&quot;Conference-2017-feb.svg&quot;</span> width=<span class=hljs-number >600</span> height=<span class=hljs-number >400</span> 
    style=<span class=hljs-string >&quot;margin:0 auto; display:block;&quot;</span> type=<span class=hljs-string >&quot;image/svg+xml&quot;</span>&gt;</code></pre>

<p>I envy Mac users with their keynote presentation tool but have never used it, though. On Linux, tools for making presentations are limited, but now I have found peace in letting Inkscape and Sozi make my presentations. However, questions arise if Sozi will still work with later versions of Inkscape as the developer decided to make a <a href="http://sozi.baierouge.fr/pages/20-install.html">standalone presentation maker</a> but fortunately still hosts the old version.</p>
<p>There are some annoyances with making presentations with Inkscape. The first one is some bug which sometimes makes Inkscape unable to start its extensions &#40;for example, Sozi and Tex Text&#41;; thus, some restarts of Inkscape are usual. Another irritation mainly comes from the limitation of the Inkscape extension model is that it takes too many clicks to add a new slide. Also, videos do not work in Google Chrome; thus, Firefox must be used to show them. These are, however, minor annoyances and take much less time than time to focus on content.</p>
