# Development of the PeaceFounder project

The goal of PeaceFounder is to explore the feasibility of a publically verifiable software-independent voting system where votes are signed in plaintext with braided pseudonyms. Many substantial decisions on user experience, security assumptions and design are taken frequently, and most of the time, it is a learning journey. As a result, the system design has evolved unrecognisably over the years. Here I blog on the new developments in the project and how I see the evoting problem. 

The current articles come from the beginning of the project and provide only historical records of what things have been explored. In contrast to the main blog page, I have not edited them with Grammarly, and thus could be more readable. Nevertheless, that reminds me to convert my internal notes to exciting blog posts soon.
