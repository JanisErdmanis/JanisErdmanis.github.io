However, I struggled with its usability - the need to interact with a mouse in many places, browser spell checker, fast notification of a new email, multiple account management and lack of emacs way of writing the text. In the process, I tried Geary, which was good but sometimes crashed, and Nylas1, which had instant email notifications but became buggy and needed to be actively developed.</p> <p>With getting to know emacs better, I was pushed into its keyboard binding, a beautiful way of extending functionality that made writing efficient and distraction-free. I looked up how email works on emacs and came across <code>mu4e</code> with which I now work with three accounts. I can write, search and read emails very fast and do no need an internet connection. That sometimes is convenient, for example, to look at the booking of a hostel or a flight.</p> <p>To get my almost perfect setup, I struggled a lot. I had to fight a bug which corrupted the index database; I had to develop a way to have multiple accounts while not having them all in one pot; Because emails were stored locally, I had to create a cron job to update them and the account for network connection failures; Learn to store them under encrypted folder; Dealing with emacs failures due to mu4e plugin running in the background; There are many problems which had overwhelmed me since last In October when I started to take email clients in emacs seriously. Fortunately, it has worked flawlessly for the previous two months, and I have solved my frustration with usability.</p> <h2 id=syncing_email_accounts ><a href="#syncing_email_accounts" class=header-anchor >Syncing email accounts</a></h2> <p>Before downloading an email, we need a <a href="https://help.ubuntu.com/community/EncryptedPrivateDirectory">safe encrypted place</a> to store it. That can be easily done with Ubuntu, where you need to execute the following commands:</p> <pre><code class="bash hljs"><span class=hljs-built_in >sudo</span> apt-get install ecryptfs-utils
ecrypt-setup-private</code></pre> <p>and follow the instructions in a terminal to create an encrypted <code>Private</code> folder in your home directory.</p> <p>To sync emails, I use <code>mbsync</code>, which is installed with:</p> <pre><code class="bash hljs"><span class=hljs-built_in >sudo</span> apt-get install isysnc</code></pre>
<p>This command asks for a configuration file which for my Gmail account looks as follows:</p>
<pre><code class="plaintext hljs">IMAPStore master
Host imap.gmail.com
User akels14@gmail.com
Pass XXXXXXX
UseIMAPS yes
RequireSSL yes
CertificateFile /etc/ssl/certs/ca-certificates.crt

MaildirStore slave
Path ~/Private/Email/akels14/

Channel inbox
Master &quot;:master:INBOX&quot;
Slave &quot;:slave:inbox&quot;
Create Both
Expunge Both
SyncState *

Channel sent
Master &quot;:master:[Gmail]/Sent Mail&quot;
Slave &quot;:slave:sent&quot;
Create Both
Expunge Both
SyncState *</code></pre>
<p>for the fields written, go to the man page of <code>mbsync</code> &#40;<code>man mbsync</code>&#41;. I name this file <code>mbsync-ak.conf</code> and then synchronise all my email into <code>~/Private/Email/akels14</code> folder with a command &#40;since password is written in plaintext, I also put that in my <code>Private</code> folder&#41;</p>
<pre><code class="bash hljs">mbsync -c ~/Private/.config/mbsync-ak.conf inbox sent</code></pre>
<p>The first run takes about an hour for me, but then it is done. One warning must be given <strong>Since <code>mbsync</code> does synchronise emails between master and slave, it can also delete emails at master if a file is deleted locally &#40;slave&#41;.</strong> Fortunately, all emails deleted except the trash directory can be found in the <code>Archive</code> folder. That saved my ass a couple of times when I tried to make sense of <code>mbsync</code> settings.</p>
<p>To be useful, synchronisation needs to work all the time &#40;but some may prefer to do it on demand&#41;, which I accomplish with a cronjob. To start writing commands in crontab, execute <code>crontab -e,</code> and write the following lines in it:</p>
<pre><code class="plaintext hljs">PATH=/opt/someApp/bin:/usr/local/sbin:/usr/local/bin:/usr/sbin:/usr/bin:/sbin:/bin
* * * * * flock -n /tmp/mbsync-ak.lock timeout 300 mbsync -c /home/janiserdmanis/Private/.config//mbsync-ak.conf inbox sent</code></pre>
<p>The path variable is a neat workaround for avoiding writing full paths of applications - flock, timeout, <code>mbsync</code>. This script will synchronise email every minute, and if the network connection fails or if large files need to be downloaded, cron will wait &#40;flock&#41; for full synchronisation for 300 seconds &#40;timeout&#41; until the command is executed again. And that is about all needed to have synchronisation at every minute to be set up, and adding multiple accounts follows the same pattern.</p>
<h2 id=reading_and_sending_emails ><a href="#reading_and_sending_emails" class=header-anchor >Reading and sending emails</a></h2>
<p>To read synchronised emails, we will need emacs and <code>mu4e</code> installed by:</p>
<pre><code class="bash hljs"><span class=hljs-built_in >sudo</span> apt-get install mu emacs</code></pre>
<p>Now to run mu4e, we create an <code>init.el</code> file with the following contents:</p>
<pre><code class="plaintext hljs">(require &#x27;mu4e&#x27;)
(setq mu4e-maildir (expand-file-name &quot;~/Private/Email/akels14&quot;))</code></pre>
<p>and run that with a simple command:</p>
<pre><code class="bash hljs">emacs --load init-simple.el --<span class=hljs-built_in >eval</span> <span class=hljs-string >&quot;(mu4e)&quot;</span></code></pre>
<p>where command after <code>--eval</code>, which can be put at the end of <code>init.el</code>, is executed after initial <code>init.el</code> is loaded. To see new emails, you have to index them, which is done with keybinding <code>U</code> &#40;next time would be instantaneous&#41;. That updates by default db under <code>~/.mu</code>.</p>
<p>The last step to having a functional email client is configuring SMTP, responsible for sending emails. That can be done in the <code>init.el</code> by adding the following lines:</p>
<pre><code class="plaintext hljs">(require &#x27;smtpmail)
(setq user-full-name  &quot;Janis Erdmanis&quot;)
(setq mu4e-user-mail-address-list &#x27;(&quot;akels14@gmail.com&quot; &quot;XXXX@gmail.com&quot;))
(setq user-mail-address &quot;akels14@gmail.com&quot;)
(setq mu4e-reply-to-address &quot;akels14@gmail.com&quot;)</code></pre>
<p>One address list so mu4e know your mail addresses, one for mu4e to know which address to use for composing and the last address to be given to the recipient, so he is pushed to reply to a given address, which is a fairly good spot for your protected spam-free email address.</p>
<p>Then when I move into the navigation and find an email I want to reply to, I press <code>R</code>. With the configuration so far presented, I would be asked for my account details to send a mail with SMTP, which would be stored in plaintext in <code>~/.authinfo</code>. The contents of the file are as follows:</p>
<pre><code class="plaintext hljs">machine smtp.gmail.com login graphitewriter port 587 password xxxxxxx
machine smtp.gmail.com login akels14 port 587 password xxxxxxxx</code></pre>
<p>where the corresponding line to your email address used for sending will is picked up automatically, one warning must be emphasised <strong>do not store passwords in plaintext</strong>. To avoid that move, I moved <code>.authinfo</code> file to the Private folder and symlink that with a command.</p>
<pre><code class="bash hljs"><span class=hljs-built_in >ln</span> -s ~/Private/.config/authinfo ~/.authinfo</code></pre>
<p>Similarly, one can move <code>~/.mu</code> to the Private folder for a complete security.</p>
<p>So far, this is the most basic and helpful starting point for using emacs for mail reading and sending. One can pick up this setup and modify depending on his needs and put some snippets in <code>init.el</code>, which can be found in Google as I usually do. Multiple account management and desktop integration are the most obvious next steps, which I will continue to reveal.</p>
<h2 id=multiple_account_management ><a href="#multiple_account_management" class=header-anchor >Multiple account management</a></h2>
<p>To simply manage multiple accounts, one can start emacs with a different<code>init.el</code> files by adding/modifying the following lines:</p>
<pre><code class="plaintext hljs">(setq mu4e-maildir (expand-file-name &quot;~/Private/Email/akels14&quot;))
(setq mu4e-mu-home (expand-file-name &quot;~/Private/.mu/akels14&quot;))</code></pre>
<p>where the last one is needed to have a separate index for each maildir, that should work flawlessly as long as you would be satisfied with changing windows for each account.</p>
<p>I wanted to use multiple accounts in a single window with a keyboard shortcut. Thus, I wrote/modified some scripts on the internet to have the behaviour I wanted. Firstly I put my accounts in variables &#40;I still append this to <code>init.el</code>&#41;</p>
<pre><code class="plaintext hljs">(setq mu4e-user-mail-address-list &#x27;(&quot;XXXXXX@gmail.com&quot; &quot;je11011@lu.lv&quot; &quot;akels14@gmail.com&quot;))
(setq user-full-name  &quot;Janis Erdmanis&quot;)

(defvar my-mu4e-account-alist
  `((&quot;graphitewriter&quot;
     (user-mail-address &quot;XXXXX@gmail.com&quot;)
     (mu4e-reply-to-address &quot;XXXXX@gmail.com&quot;)
     (mu4e-maildir ,(expand-file-name &quot;~/Private/Email/graphitewriter&quot;))
     (mu4e-mu-home ,(expand-file-name &quot;~/Private/.mu/graphitewriter&quot;))
     )
    (&quot;je11011&quot;
     (user-mail-address &quot;je11011@lu.lv&quot;)
     (mu4e-reply-to-address &quot;je11011@lu.lv&quot;)
     (mu4e-maildir ,(expand-file-name &quot;~/Private/Email/je11011&quot;))
     (mu4e-mu-home ,(expand-file-name &quot;~/Private/.mu/je11011&quot;))
     )
    (&quot;akels14&quot;
     (user-mail-address &quot;akels14@gmail.com&quot;)
     (mu4e-reply-to-address &quot;akels14@gmail.com&quot;)
     (mu4e-maildir ,(expand-file-name &quot;~/Private/Email/akels14&quot;))
     (mu4e-mu-home ,(expand-file-name &quot;~/Private/.mu/akels14&quot;))
     )))</code></pre>
<p>Then to change the account I simply have to execute a following function with an account name:</p>
<pre><code class="plaintext hljs">(defun mu4e-set-account (account-name)
  (interactive)
  (mu4e~proc-kill)
  (let ((vars (cdr (assoc account-name my-mu4e-account-alist))))
    (if vars
        (mapc #&#x27;(lambda (var)
                  (set (car var) (cadr var)))
              vars)
      (error &quot;No email account &#x27;%s&#x27; was found&quot; account-name)))
  ;; For having fancy mode-line
  (setq mode-line-end-spaces
        (list (propertize &quot; &quot; &#x27;display `(space :align-to (- right ,(length account-name))))
              account-name))
  ;; Also need to remove lock file which sometimes messes up
  (shell-command  (concat &quot;rm -rf &quot; mu4e-mu-home &quot;/xapian/flintlock&quot;))
  )</code></pre>
<p>which can be executed at any point in emacs with <code>M-x &#43; mu4e-set-account &#43; Enter &#43; akels14</code>.</p>
<p>By adding competition of account names and a keyboard shortcut <code>;</code> to change accounts, I was satisfied with my setup:</p>
<pre><code class="plaintext hljs">(setq my-accounts nil)
(defun printlist (mylist)
  &quot;Filling my-accounts with alist keys from mylist&quot;
  (push (car (car mylist)) my-accounts)
  (if (not (eq (length mylist) 1)) (printlist (cdr mylist))))
(printlist my-mu4e-account-alist)

(defun mu4e-set-account-interactive ()
  &quot;Changes the email account&quot;
  (interactive)
  ;(mu4e-set-account (read-string &quot;Enter the account name:&quot;))
  (setq mu4e-account (ido-completing-read &quot;Enter the account name: &quot; my-accounts))
  (mu4e-set-account mu4e-account)
  )

(add-hook &#x27;mu4e-main-mode-hook
          (lambda () (local-set-key (kbd &quot;;&quot;) #&#x27;mu4e-set-account-interactive)))</code></pre>
<p>This code part needs some reviewing, which would make it shorter, as I use global variables and make functions where I do not need them. Nevertheless, it works flawlessly.</p>
<h2 id=desktop_integration ><a href="#desktop_integration" class=header-anchor >Desktop integration</a></h2>
<p>The last step was to make desktop integration - to see instantaneously that a new email had arrived. I wanted an icon and badge showing the number of unread emails in Ubuntu. My approach uses DBus for that purpose, with which I make a daemon process and its ability to change <code>*.desktop</code> icons in the panel. Thus first, we need to make a <code>.desktop</code> icon for the emacs command.</p>
<p>The following init script is needed to let the X-window system know that a separate application is being started:</p>
<pre><code class="plaintext hljs">APPNAME=mu4e
emacs --name $APPNAME -q --load  init-simple.el &amp;
sleep 1 &amp;&amp; xprop -name $APPNAME -f WM_CLASS 8s -set WM_CLASS &quot;$APPNAME, $APPNAME&quot;</code></pre>
<p>In this script, I store this in <code>~/bin/mu4e,</code> for which I add execution permissions with <code>chmod &#43;x \~/bin/mu4e</code>. A .desktop file is being stored in <code>\~/.local/share/applications/mu4e.desktop</code> which has a following contents:</p>
<pre><code class="plaintext hljs">#!/usr/bin/env xdg-open
[Desktop Entry]
Version=1.0
Type=Application
Terminal=false
Exec=mu4e
Name=Mu4e
Comment=Simple email client based on emacs
Icon=envelope
StartupWMClass=mu4e</code></pre>
<p>where icon is stored in <code>~/.local/share/icons/envelope.png</code>. Then this application can be found in Unity Dash as <code>mu4e</code>.</p>
<p>The next step is adding a badge for this application in the taskbar to show the email count. That I do with the following script:</p>
<pre><code class="python hljs"><span class=hljs-comment >#!/usr/bin/python</span>

ccommand = <span class=hljs-string >&quot;ls ~/Private/Email/graphitewriter/inbox/new | wc -l&quot;</span>

<span class=hljs-keyword >from</span> gi.repository <span class=hljs-keyword >import</span> Unity, Gio, GObject, Dbusmenu

<span class=hljs-comment ># The mu4e must be put into ~/.local/share/applicactions</span>
launcher = Unity.LauncherEntry.get_for_desktop_id(<span class=hljs-string >&quot;mu4e.desktop&quot;</span>)

launcher.set_property(<span class=hljs-string >&quot;count&quot;</span>, <span class=hljs-number >0</span>)
launcher.set_property(<span class=hljs-string >&quot;count_visible&quot;</span>, <span class=hljs-literal >True</span>)

<span class=hljs-comment >### Defining the loop in right way</span>

<span class=hljs-keyword >import</span> commands
<span class=hljs-keyword >def</span> <span class="hljs-title function_">update_mail_count</span>():
    count = <span class=hljs-built_in >int</span>(commands.getstatusoutput(ccommand)[<span class=hljs-number >1</span>])
    launcher.set_property(<span class=hljs-string >&quot;count&quot;</span>, count)
    launcher.set_property(<span class=hljs-string >&quot;count_visible&quot;</span>, <span class=hljs-literal >True</span>)

    <span class=hljs-keyword >if</span> count&gt;<span class=hljs-number >0</span>:
        launcher.set_property(<span class=hljs-string >&quot;urgent&quot;</span>, <span class=hljs-literal >True</span>)
    <span class=hljs-keyword >else</span>:
        launcher.set_property(<span class=hljs-string >&quot;urgent&quot;</span>,<span class=hljs-literal >False</span>)

    <span class=hljs-keyword >return</span> <span class=hljs-literal >True</span>

loop = GObject.MainLoop()
GObject.timeout_add_seconds(<span class=hljs-number >1</span>, update_mail_count)
loop.run()</code></pre>
<p>which is stored in <code>~/bin/mu4e-counter</code> with <code>chmod &#43;x</code>. When this script is started, it will add a badge icon showing several files in <code>~/Private/Email/graphitewriter/inbox/new</code> where unread emails are stored and will update for changes each second. For convenience, I start this script on login by adding it in &quot;Startup Applications&quot;.</p>

<p>This barebones version is good but needs some additional snippets for better use</p>
<pre><code class="plaintext hljs">(require &#x27;mu4e-contrib)

;; For processing html emails
(setq mu4e-html2text-command &#x27;mu4e-shr2text)
