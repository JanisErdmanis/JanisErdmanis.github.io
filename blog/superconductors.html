Superconductors. Where are they actually used real life? Examples are actually pretty cool. A floating wheelless trian, a means to steer protons at high velocity in large hardron colider and if you have been lucky one you might have seen a levitating superconductor on top of a magnet.
</p>

<p>
But why does superconductors has theese supper properties? To answer that let me ivite to a place. A very special and a very cold oplace. In this place electrons and holes have to hold each other hands which is in contrast of normal metal where electrons and holes live independently. Thus interesting things happen when electron from normal metal tries to enter the superconductor.
</p>

<p>
The doorman at the superconductor says to electron that to enter the supper place you need to hold hands with another friend from superconductor. So you need  to kick your friends girlfriend  to free his hands and to enter the superconductor. And that is what electron does. But hte hole soon reaches the another doorman to get back in the super place so she kicks out an electron and so the history repeats itslef and thus it has a certian frequency. 
</p>

<p>
But it turns out that doorman is actually a kind person and most electrons can get into superconductor without kicking out the partner of his friend. So only some holes and electrons with certain frequencies like a names remains in the normal metal as prisoners.
</p>

<p>
It turns out that as physicists we are able to say what are the rules doorman will for prisoners coming from a normal metal by changing parametrs for superconductors. And interestingly at the time we changfe the rules we actually see prisoners escape. But soon others are stuffed in.
</p>

<p>
The prisoners can escape and new ones come in, if prisoners are pushed by voltage. Where easisness of pushing we call a conductivity. Prisoners however know that easier way out is by making friends with prisoners of the same frequency. Then they are able to win a doorman much easally and we do see that as a sharp decrease of conductivity.
</p>

<p>
So to wrap up my research is about understanding doormens so the could be adjusted in a way prisoners could form a friends and to see if such jump of conductivity could be seen in the experiment. And that would add another phenomena which we observe regarding to superconductors. Perhaps that turns out usefull to enslave prisoners to do some quantum computation. Who knows&#x2026; Isn't that cool?
