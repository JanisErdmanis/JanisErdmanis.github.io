In the environment we live in, we have a limited capability to finance public goods such as media, open-source projects and political parties. Subscription model just does not cut it. Thus we rely on the state or from the advertisement model. Here I propose an alternative fundraising strategy based on transparent, anonymous, user verifiable electronic voting scheme.</p> <p>The first step is to establish a git-based repository, where proposals, resulting votes and public keys would sit in. The contributors with merge rights would fill the role of the state, which ensures that all votes are being counted and has executive powers to deliver the result of the democratic choice. For example, ensuring that participating parties transfer funds according to a promise.</p> <p>The promise of parties to finance the voted proposals is the credit for the democracy. It is thus natural to give the rights of merging motions, votes, and new members to the participating parties as that gives them the power to purge disobeying parties or to fork and purge the ruthless majority as their member entrusted capital depends on their responsible actions.</p> <h2 id=establishing_a_credit ><a href="#establishing_a_credit" class=header-anchor >Establishing a Credit</a></h2> <ul> <li><p>A git repo with a set of democracy rules and goals is established</p> <li><p>The author of the repository looks for support from activist groups or political parties who are willing to collect and keep funds for the democracy and so establishing credit for the democracy</p> <li><p>The activist group or political party is added to the board of members with merge rights.</p> </ul> <h2 id=establishing_a_voters_registry ><a href="#establishing_a_voters_registry" class=header-anchor >Establishing a voters registry</a></h2> <ul> <li><p>A potential member founds the website of democracy.
