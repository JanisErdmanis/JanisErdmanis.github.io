        My name is Janis (Yanis). I have a PhD from TU Delft on the quantum effects of the superconducting phase. My passion is to seek a frame of reference to which perceived complexity becomes simple, concise and understandable, driving my lifelong learning. I enjoy building software which is robust and resilient to changing environment serving all stakeholder's needs.
      </p>
      <p>
        I have comprehensive expertise in Julia full-stack development, encompassing a range of technologies, including HTTP, and QML, as well as the occasional utilisation of Javascript, HTML, and CSS. I possess hands-on knowledge in implementing cryptographic schemes and protocols. My involvement in the PeaceFounder project allowed me to apply concepts like public key cryptography, zero-knowledge proofs, Merkle trees, and blind signature schemes. Furthermore, I have successfully orchestrated the construction of a system from the ground up, employing both hexagonal and model-view-controller architectural paradigms. This endeavour culminated in a substantial 15,000-line codebase.

      <h2 class="title">PeaceFounder</h2>
      <p class="copy">
The goal of PeaceFounder is to explore the feasibility of a publically verifiable software-independent voting system where votes are signed in plaintext with braided pseudonyms. I propose using one mix at a time, dropping the usual ceremonial secret commitments and propose a bulletin board implementation using <b>Merkle tree</b> inclusion and consistency proofs to guarantee the immutability and persistence of the ballot box ledger just by having some honest clients which periodically download the proofs.

      <p class="copy">
This is a full-stack project with a total of <b>15k lines of Julia</b> code. Following NIST specification, I have reimplemented cryptographic groups and signatures and reimplemented from a research paper a Verificatum compatible verifier and prover for <b>zero-knowledge proofs</b> of shuffle. The server's backend exposes <b>REST API</b> over <b>HTTP</b> using <b>JSON</b> for communication. The client is made with <b>QML</b> and bridged with the client's backend.

      <h2 class="title">My PhD thesis</h2>
      <p class="copy">
        My PhD thesis explores properties of superconducting nanostructures at cold tempertures in different settings with different manifestations of topology in their superconducting phase. In the result working with my supervisour and a postdoc I have published four peer reviewed papers and supervised one master student. Apart from doing Taylor expansions, setting up hamiltoninian, diagonalizing, simulating time evolution of a quantum system with Schrodingers equation or solving stochastic differential equations and using <b>PBS</b> cluster with 200 cores at one point are some of the things I did as a part of my PhD using <b>Julia</b>

      <h2 class="title">Magnetic micro-droplet in rotating field</h2>
      <p class="copy">
        A small magnetic droplet is suspended on a petry dish and a fast rotating magnetic field is turned on. An equilibrium of the magnetization force with a surface tension forms exhibiting rich range of shapes observed experimentally. To test the hypothesis I built a computer simulation in <b>Julia</b> and designed the numerical metdhod from scratch travesring all surface triangles to calculate surface force at every node to evolve the surface into equilibrium where I wraped <b>C++</b> ElTopo library to adaptivelly refine the surface mesh. <b>ssh</b> and <b>tmux</b> was indespensable to leave my simulations runing on my university's workstation for days.

      <h2 class="title">Electron on-demand emission</h2>
      <p class="copy">At a nanoscale in Helium boiling temperatures and large magnetic fields an electron for few centimeters flows just like photons on optical fibers coherently. This enables to envision an electron interferometer experiment on a solid state device and thus question on the prepereations of a electron quantum state becomes important. In this project I derived and using <b>python</b> computed the reesulting state of an electron emitted from a electric field veil lowering one of it's barriers.
